## Context
**Files to read (ONLY these):**
- SWARM/SCRIPTS/swarm.py (reference only - file doesn't exist yet)

## Objective
Create a minimal `swarm.py` script with basic command structure and `--help` flag.

## Deliverables
- [ ] Create `SWARM/SCRIPTS/swarm.py` with basic CLI structure
- [ ] Add `--help` and `-h` flag support
- [ ] Include usage text showing available commands
- [ ] Add stub functions for `spawn`, `status`, `merge` commands

## Constraints
- Max 100 lines of new code
- Max 2 files
- No new dependencies (Python stdlib only)
- 4-minute timebox

## Notes
Keep it minimal. Just the skeleton structure with help text.
Commands don't need full implementation yet - stubs are fine.
Focus on clean CLI interface.
